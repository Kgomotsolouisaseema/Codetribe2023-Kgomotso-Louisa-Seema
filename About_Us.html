            <h1> Who am I ?</h1>
            <P>I’m a women on a mission ,I am the dreams and cries of those who came before me , I am Spirit , Body and Being.
                I am  the first child of my mother and sister to a beautiful, wild flower also finding her way in this wilderness. <br> I grew up around the province of Gauteng but I’ve  always wanted to travel the world. <br> Because of this desire of travelling, I asked mother to take me to  a particular private school where I could study Hospitality and Catering , Computer Application Technology and Tourism. <br> This decision would till this day inform all my plans and direction for life and how I pursue it. <br> Because cooking was my favourite of all being that I love hosting people and having people enjoy my food ,I focused on it more .
               
                I went to college  and studied the course and finally started travelling to USA. In the year I was an immigrant, I made the most of life and the possibilities of it. I enjoyed the hard work and long hours, the new scenery and visited other towns and met with the “locals”.<br> When the year was complete, I didn’t want to leave but I knew I couldn’t stay legally, I came back home to see family and friends and carry on my travels to other wonderful destinations or so I thought.
